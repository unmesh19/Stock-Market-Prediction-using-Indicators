# Short Time Stock Market Prediction using Indicators

This project predicts short-term stock market movements by analyzing recent stock data and applying technical indicators to detect potential buy or sell signals for short-term trading.

## Features:
- Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- Calculates short-term indicators like Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Relative Strength Index (RSI).
- Generates actionable buy and sell signals based on short-term movements in the stock price.
- Interactive visualizations of stock prices, EMAs, MACD, and RSI for short-term analysis.

## Key Indicators Used:
1. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: 12-day and 26-day EMAs.
2. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: Difference between the 12-day and 26-day EMAs.
3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Measures overbought or oversold conditions, calculated over a 14-day period.

## How It Works:
1. Select a company from a predefined list.
2. Fetch stock data for that company, focusing on short-term timeframes (e.g., the last few months).
3. Compute key indicators like EMA, MACD, and RSI based on the recent stock data.
4. Generate buy or sell signals:
   - **Buy Signal**: When the price is above the 12-day EMA, MACD crosses above the signal line, and RSI is between 30 and 70.
   - **Sell Signal**: When the price is below the 12-day EMA, MACD crosses below the signal line, or RSI is above 70.
5. Display plots showing stock prices, EMAs, MACD, and RSI.
